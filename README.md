# pytextlib

A collection of simple utility functions for common text-processing tasks in Python.

This project was created to provide reliable, easy-to-use tools for the small but repetitive challenges often found when working with text.

---

## ✨ Features

This library provides a growing collection of text-processing utilities. For a complete and up-to-date list of all available functions, please refer to the main `pytextlib/__init__.py` file.

Currently available functions include:
*   `slugify`: Converts a string into a URL-friendly slug.
*   `truncate_text`: Truncates a string to a specified length.
*   `parse_csv`: Parses a CSV string into a list of dictionaries.

## 🚀 Installation

> Note: This library is not yet available on PyPI. For now, you can use the functions by copying the source code into your project.

## ✍️ Usage

Each function is fully documented with detailed docstrings. You can view usage instructions directly in your code editor or by using Python's built-in `help()` function.

**Basic Example (`slugify`):**

```
from pytextlib import slugify

# The docstring for slugify will appear in your editor!
url_slug = slugify("Hello, World! This is pytextlib.")
print(url_slug)
# Output: hello-world-this-is-pytextlib
```

## 🗺️ Roadmap

*   Text validators (e.g., for email addresses)
